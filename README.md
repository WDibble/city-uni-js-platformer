# platformer-demo
A Demo of my Year 1 Java Project, a Platformer Game.

The included CityEngine.jar is required to run the project. 
When using an IDE add the Engine to your global libraries.

This project took approximately 2 months to create, 
it stil has holes in the code and fixes to be made but it is the result of my first year project.
